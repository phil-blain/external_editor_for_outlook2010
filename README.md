## Configurations

You can configure the environment of your external editor with the following constants. You can find them at the beginning of "external_editor.vba".

* `EDITOR_PATH`  
  Absolute path to your external editor  
  e.g. If you use [xyzzy](https://github.com/xyzzy-022/xyzzy) as your external editor, set `EDITOR_PATH` to `"C:\...\xyzzy.exe"`.
* `TEMP_DIR`  
  Absolute path to the directory in which temporary files are saved  
  This variable must end with "`\`". The directory must already exist.
* `REMOVE_TEMP_FILES`  
  If this is set to `True`, this macro removes temporary files after you close the external editor.  
  If this is set to `False`, this macro leave temporary files for fail safe.


## Note and limitations

* If you edit your mail content within the mail editor of Outlook while you edit it within the external editor, the content edited in Outlook editor will be lost when you close the external editor.
* Temporary files are saved as UTF-8 with BOM.  
  Your external editor should support this encoding.
* This macro is under development. If you are unlucky, you may face a crash of Outlook...
